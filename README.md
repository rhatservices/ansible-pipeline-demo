# Ansibel Pipeline Demo

This repository contains a demo that demonstrate how to

- Validate Ansible in an automated fashion
- Merging changes automatically to different repository branches after validation
- Trigger Ansible Controller jobs after merging

## Motivation

Using Ansible for automation is only a starting point in a longer
journey. For most larger automation setups the following questions
arise after automating the first tasks:

- How can we test our Ansible code base before applying it to
  production system?
- Which tools are available for testing Ansible code?
- Is it possible to fully automate the whole workflow of testing
  Ansible code and bringing it to production?

Answering the questions above when starting with a blank page is
hard. There are multiple solutions and even more tools to achieve the
desired result.

This Demo setup tries to answer some of these questions. We only
scratch the surface of what's actually possible. It's not the
definitive answer but should help getting started without staring at a
blank page.

## Tools

We use the following tools to implement our pipeline

- [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/):
  - Storing our Ansible code base and
  - our Ansible Controller configuration
- [Tektion](https://tekton.dev/) for implementing our pipeline
- [Ansible Controller](https://www.ansible.com/products/controller)
  for executing Ansible code

## Pipeline overview

The graphic depicts our proposed setup:

![Overview](images/overview.drawio.png)

We are going to deploy required tools in 3 separate OpenShift namespace:

- gitea: for installation of Gitea
- ansible-pipeline: for storing required Tekton pipeline objects like
  - Tasks
  - Pipelines
  - EventTriggers
- ansible-automation-platform: for our installation of a minimal
  Automation Controller instance

Don't worry about setting up all those tools, we got you covered
here. See section [Setup](#Setup).

## Why OpenShift?

Simple because we can and OpenShift provides an easy way of setting up
our infrastructure via tools like [Helm](https://helm.io) or
[Operators](https://operatorhub.io/).

OpenShift is not a strong requirement, any Kubernetes distribution or
even upstream Kubernetes could also be leveraged.

> :warning: **Persistent storage is required**: For Gitea and the
> Automation Controller you are going to need persistent storage in
> OpenShift or Kubernetes.

Deploying our pipeline would also be possible without OpenShift. The
only thing that needs to be replaces is Tekton. But there are plenty
of tools available for replacement:

- [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io) for the classic CI/CD tooling
- [Gitlab pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/)

or various pipelines as a service implementations like

- [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/)
- [Travis](https://www.travis-ci.com/)
